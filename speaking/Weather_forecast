# Weather forecast
① 系统在干嘛（Weather System Movement）
A low is moving in（低压系统正在逼近）
A deepening low（正在增强的低压）
The front is moving across（锋面正在移动）
The system is hanging around（天气系统持续停留）
Run through the weekend（贯穿整个周末）
Into early next week（持续到下周初）

📌 Authentic Examples（来自你看的NZ Weather Forecast）：
Watch as that low works in
The first set of fronts moving across parts of the South Island
The front pushes through
That area there hangs in
The low is still there
The low is working
As we run through the weekend
Back to western parts early next week
Steering winds are keeping the low from moving away

② 为什么会下雨（Rain Causes）
Tropical moisture（热带湿气）
Moisture feeding in（湿气持续输入）
Cold air moving in（冷空气进入）
The low is grabbing energy（低压吸收能量）

📌 Authentic Examples：
You're sitting and spraying that tropical moisture
With all that tropical moisture
That's the beginnings of the tropical moisture
It will feed in
Because you've got cold air
The energy it grabs just deepens the low
It's all coming together

③ 雨有多大（Rainfall Intensity）
Heavy rain（大雨）Persistent rain（持续性降雨）Heavy downpours（强降雨）
Rainfall wise（从降雨量来看）
Up to around 200 millimeters（最高可达200毫米）

📌 Authentic Examples：
You have heavy persistent rain
Some really heavy downpours
That means a lot of rain
You could be seeing 50 to 100 millimeters of rain very quickly
Up to around 200 millimeters of rain in the ranges
We're going up to the top of the scale – that's 150 millimeters

④ 风有多大（Wind）
Strong winds（强风）Damaging winds（破坏性强风）
Winds picking up（风力增强）
Winds up to 130 km/h（风速可达130公里每小时）
Steering winds（引导气流）

📌 Authentic Examples：
Strong damaging winds
With those strong winds
They could be 130 kilometers per hour
Strong winds start working
Steering winds are keeping the low from moving away

⑤ 海浪 / 洪水风险（Coastal Risk）
Increased swell（海浪增强） Coastal inundation（沿海淹没）
Bear in mind high tide（注意涨潮）
Across coastal areas（沿海地区）

📌 Authentic Examples：
Increased swell up to six meters
Might see that coastal inundation
The risk for coastal inundation
Bear in mind high tide across coastal areas

⑥ Kiwi Metaphors（预报员爱用的口语比喻 ⭐️）
📌 Authentic Examples：
It’s a bit of a one-two-three punch 这简直就是三重打击！
Think of having a big fire hose
You're spraying in one location for a long time
Then you turn around and spray the other side
It's like having a bonfire
